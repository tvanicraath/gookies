gookies

`gookies = gujarati + cookies` :P


This is the list of '%' seperated Gujarati quotes that I use as fortune cookies.


I will add more of this gems as and when I encounter them. You are most welcome to contribute any interesting quotes you find.
Please take care of the delimiter while adding more quotes.

I had initially thought of naming it as `motichaaro`, but I am too lazy to type that again and again. A more innovative name is welcome!
